# Employee Management System (Java MVC Model)

### Overview

The Employee Management System is a Java-based application designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This system allows for efficient management of employee records including adding, updating, and deleting employee information. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with employee data and demonstrates the use of MVC principles to separate concerns and improve code maintainability.

### Features

- **Add Employee**: Allows users to input and save new employee records.
- **Update Employee**: Enables modification of existing employee details.
- **Delete Employee**: Provides functionality to remove employee records from the system.
- **View Employee**: Displays a list of employees and their details.
- **Search Employee**: Facilitates searching for specific employees based on various criteria.

### Architecture

- **Model**: Represents the data structure of the employee records. This includes classes and methods to handle employee data and interactions with the database.
- **View**: Provides the user interface components through which users interact with the system. This includes forms, tables, and dialog boxes.
- **Controller**: Manages user inputs and interacts with the Model to update the View. It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.

### Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for implementing the system.
- **Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface.
- **JDBC**: For database connectivity (if using a database to store employee records).
